# React Native Expo App with Maestro E2E Testing ðŸ‘‹

This is a simple React Native project built with [Expo](https://expo.dev) and configured with [Maestro](https://maestro.dev) for end-to-end testing. The project was created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Maestro E2E Testing

This project comes pre-configured with Maestro for end-to-end testing. To get started with Maestro:

1. **Install Maestro** following the official installation guide:
   - [Installing Maestro](https://docs.maestro.dev/getting-started/installing-maestro)

2. **Learn about E2E testing with Expo and Maestro**:
